                TRAFFIC NETWORK MANAGEMENT</li>
            <li><b>Time Duration:</b> December 2018 to April 2019</li>
            <li><b>Project Solution:</b> The main mantra of this project is <q>SAFE DRIVE & SAVE LIFE</q>. Its primary
                aim is
                to illustrate how mathematics is applied in our daily lives through the concepts of fuzzy logic. The
                project seeks to contribute towards making our roadways safer and free from traffic accidents by
                utilizing fuzzy logic and Matlab's fuzzy toolbox. Matlab enables us to generate statistical
                representations that aid in managing and controlling traffic. This analysis assists traffic control
                sectors in analyzing traffic patterns over specific periods, thereby preventing traffic congestion
